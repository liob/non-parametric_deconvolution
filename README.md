Clinical parameters for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are of paramount importance in determining clinical parameters for the identification of biomarkers for treatment and therapy monitoring. This is the companion repository for the [JMRI] publication: "Deep Semantic Lung Segmentation for Tracking Potential Pulmonary Perfusion Biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis COPD Study in Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging." The code implements a non-parametric deconvolution for 4D DCE MRI scans.
